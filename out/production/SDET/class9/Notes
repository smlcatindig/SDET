Arrays:
a collection of items. We can store primitive and non-primitive data inside arrays.
Why we should learn about Arrays?
1.) they help us manage large amounts of data efficiently
2.) we can process the data stored in arrays using loops

Syntax:
we have two ways of creating the arrays
1.) datatype[] name={element 1, element 2, element 3};
example int[] number={10,20,60}
2.) datatype[] name=new datatype[size]
int[] numbers=new int[5]
Enhanced For loop:
its another type of loop that we can use with data structures it automatically
picks the items from the array and prints them one by one in each iteration.
Why should we use Enhanced?
1.) cleaner code
2.) easier to understand
Syntax:
for(datatype variable:arrayName){
}
Limitations of the Enhanced For loop:
1.) There is no index which means we will always get the data in the sequence it is present in the array
2.) we can't print the items in reverse order
3.) we can't update the values as well


Shortcuts:
1.) after the array type iter and intellij will write an enhanced for loop for you
2.) we can place the cursor on the for loop and click on the bulb icon to change
one loop with another one
